      Taking a solo trip might truly be one of the best things a woman can do. It’s incredibly brave to set out to 
      explore a faraway land on your own and doubly rewarding.
      <br /><br />
      But traveling without friends, family, or a significant other also means that you’ll need to be hyper-aware
      of your surroundings to protect yourself from unwanted crime or attention.
      <br /><br />
      When packing for your first solo excursion, it’s important to take a few extra precautions to ensure your
      travels not only go smoothly, but safely. These 11 products are designed to help prevent or negotiate a range 
      of compromising situations you may encounter on the road, giving you the peace of mind to savor every second of 
      your solo journey, without worry.

      Your dad might have gifted you with an, ahem, unnecessary set of pepper sprays and Swiss Army knives to 
      protect you before you head to Southeast Asia for a few months, but this upgrade to the traditional whistle 
      is both practical and pretty. While at first glance — and to passersby — it appears to be a statement necklace, 
      it’s actually a super-loud whistle you can use if you’re ever in a tricky situation and need assistance.
      <br /><br />
      Especially for when you’re trekking through South or Central America where a daily thunderstorm is not only 
      likely but expected, you’ll need something that keeps you dry and prevents you from seeking help from strangers
      to escape the rain. Instead of carrying around a travel-sized umbrella that won’t do the job or a bulky rain 
      jacket, consider this dual-function scarf. When it starts to sprinkle, pull out the hood that’s tucked away in
      the pocket of this water-resistant buy and continue on your way. As a bonus, it also features two concealed 
      compartments where you can store your credit card, keys, or other valuables you want to hide.
        <br /><br />
      Stuck at the bus station without an outlet? This hardsided spinner features an easily removable power bank to
      keep your tech charged no matter how long you’re passing time at the airport. It also sports a TSA-approved 
      lock, so you can doze off while awaiting your boarding call without fretting. You also can equip the suitcase
      with a Tile Bluetooth tracker to be sure your checked bag made the connection with you, and you can even use 
      your suitcase to find your phone by pressing the Tile will make it ring even if it’s set to silent mode.
        <br /><br />
      Your initial inclination might be to skip a flashlight since your phone likely has one and they’re bulky, but 
      what happens if you’re out of battery and you need light to unlock your bike in Kyoto? Illuminating your path 
      is never a bad idea, and with this light that’s the size of a pen, you won’t feel like you’re lugging around
      excess weight.
       <br /><br />
      Moreso than any travel guide or tour you could take, your gut will often lead you in the right direction. Even 
      if there’s no immediate threat, if you’re in a situation where you feel uncomfortable, getting away from the 
      area ASAP is in your best interest. That’s why this inexpensive and tiny keychain alarm is a smart idea. When 
      you remove the black pin, a loud — and apparently, annoying — sound will blast for up to 30 minutes, turning
      off any unruly characters from following you or standing near you and attracting help if you need it.
       <br /><br />
      Considering the vast majority of the world doesn’t have tap water you can guzzle down when you get back to your
      Airbnb or hostel, purifying your H2O becomes an important task. Not only will you save on buying endless water
      bottles that leave a negative footprint on the environment, but you’ll save your stomach from upset, too. 
      These on-the-go GoPure pods remove lead, chlorine, and chromium from water, reducing the likelihood of
      travel-related illnesses.
      <br /><br />
      How many times have you stared in awe at the number of steps you took in a single day of travel? Between 
      scaling the length of an airport and checking off every monument, museum, and attraction in a given city,
      your hotel or hostel is merely used as a place to crash. In addition to stocking up on sunscreen, it’s also
      important to stay hydrated. The only downfall is most cross-body bags aren’t big enough to hold your trusty 
      water bottle. The solution? This trendy new bag holds 17 ounces of water, with a straw right in the strap.
      Done and done.
      <br /><br />
      Leave your cutesy backpack at home this time. You won’t want to attract double-taps on Instagram at the risk
      of appealing to pickpockets, too. Keep your valuables protected with this pick from PacSafe, a trusted travel 
      brand for on-the-go accessories. This 25-liter backpack has safety features like slash-proof fabric, straps 
      that will lock onto the chair or table when you’re eating dining alfresco, and zipper pulls that discreetly 
      hook shut. It also expands to fit everything you’d need for a long weekend getting lost in the wonder of a new 
      city.
