      Loyalty programs would continue to be led by stamp collection programs into the early 1900’s. 
      Beyond this point, individual brands and retailers began to introduce their own ways of engaging customers, 
      with "box tops" as one of the original brand specific programs.

      Box tops were coupons that were printed directly onto product packages that could be later redeemed for 
      premiums or rewards. Betty Crocker introduced their box top program in 1929, laying the framework for loyalty
       programs as we know them today.

      The late 1900’s saw the birth of one of the most well-known loyalty programs ever created: Frequent Fliers. 
      Often regarded as the first full-scale loyalty program of the modern era, American Airlines' launched their 
      Frequent Flier program in 1981. The program revolutionized customer loyalty and now boasts over 50 million 
      members in their revamped AAdvantage program!
